# Netflix Data Analysis

This project analyzes a Netflix dataset using Python to extract key insights into the platform's content, trends, and patterns. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of Netflix's movie and TV show catalog, and provide visualizations of important metrics like content distribution, genre popularity, and release trends over time.


## Overview
The **Netflix Data Analysis** project aims to explore and analyze the Netflix dataset, focusing on understanding the content distribution by genre, release year, and type (movie or TV show). Using Python's data analysis libraries, we perform data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization to uncover interesting trends.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle]
- **Contents**: The dataset contains information about TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2021, including details like title, director, cast, country, date of release, rating, and more.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of Netflix content by type (movies vs. TV shows).
- Explore content distribution across different countries and genres.
- Examine trends in content release over time.
- Identify popular genres and rating patterns.
- Visualize key insights and trends using Python libraries.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: For data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and aggregation.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization and graphical analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing code and presenting analysis in a structured manner.

## Key Insights
- Content distribution shows a larger number of movies compared to TV shows on Netflix.
- The most common genres are Drama, International Movies, and Comedies.
- The number of Netflix originals has increased significantly in recent years.
- Specific countries, like the USA and India, contribute the most content to the platform.
- TV shows tend to have higher user ratings compared to movies.


## Visualizations
The analysis includes various visualizations, such as:
- Bar charts for content distribution by genre and country.
- Line charts showing the number of releases per year.
- Pie charts representing the share of movies vs. TV shows.
- Heatmaps and other visual tools to highlight trends and patterns.
